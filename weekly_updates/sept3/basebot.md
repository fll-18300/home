# Basebot Expert
### Thank you for being our basebot expet!  Get us ready to write programs by downloading and updating the base robot python code
- It is no fun being stuck and not knowing what to do next.  Your coaches want to help you and provide expert help anytime you need it. Ask questions if you get stuck when following the directions below.    
- Watch the video in [this link click here](https://fssfll.github.io/fssfll/spike/lessons/spike_basecode/spike_basecode/) and read the page.  Pay attention to the bolton_robotics_robot.py description on the page as this is the file we need to change.
  - As shown in the video, [click here to download the BaseCode](https://fssfll.github.io/fssfll/spike/lessons/spike_basecode/spike_basecode-release_1.zip)       
  - Then start the Pybricks Software [https://code.pybricks.com/](https://code.pybricks.com/)
  - Import the spike_basecode-release_1.zip you previously downloaded
  - Determine the wiring of your basebot.  Make a simple top view drawing showing the motors and any sensors.
     - Label the motors:
       - "LDM" Left Drive Motor
       - "RDM" Right Drive Motor
       - "RAM" Right Attachment Motor
       - "LAM" Left Attachment Motor
- Next watch the video in [this link click here](https://fssfll.github.io/fssfll/spike/lessons/spike_customizing/spike_customizing/)
     - Follow the instructions and update:
       - PORT_MAPPING
       - WHEEL_DIAMETER
       - AXEL_TRACK
       - DISPLAY_ORIENTATION
- Use the test programs to see if your robot is working correctly
- Update basebot build instructions to match basebot (Kyle may need to do this)
