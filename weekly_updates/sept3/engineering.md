# Engineering Design Process Expert
### Thank you for being our engineering design process expert!  The engineering design process is an approach many engineering teams use to quickly go from an idea to a working design.
Your coaches are here to provide expert help!  If you get stuck or have questions, just ask!

### Do some research and answer the following questions.  Be sure to write down your answers in a shared doc or some easy way to share what you've done with the team 
- This is an example of the steps in an engineering design process:

  Notice how it is represented as a closed loop?  That is an important aspect of any engineering design process because if the design does not work the first time, you can discuss and identify what went wrong, design a fix, build a prototype, and finally test and re-evaluate it.

- What is the engineering design process?
- Describe some important steps in the process? (the steps can vary a bit)
- What does it mean to iterate the design?
- Give an example of how we can use one of the steps of the engineering design process when building our robot?
