### Prepare for our Interview with an archeologist!
Interviewing an expert is a key part of the FLL project.  We need to understand what an archeologist does, the tools they use, and what makes their job challenging, tedious, or difficult.  As an FLL team, our task is to work with an expert to identify a challenge and try to solve that challenge.  
Break into teams of 2 and come up with 5-10 questions.  
Here are some example questions to get us going:
- When you’re working on a dig, what is the most time-consuming part?
- How do you keep track of where each artifact was found, and what makes that difficult?
- What mistakes or problems might happen when cataloging finds?
- What tools or technologies do you use now for documentation, and what do you wish worked better?
- What challenges come up when you need to share your findings with other archaeologists or museums?
- Do you ever have trouble matching artifacts to their exact location once they’re removed from the site?
- If you could invent a “dream tool” that would make recording what was found at the site easier, what would it do?
- What happens to the artifacts?  How do you share your findings with other people or the public?

### Team Experts
Become an expert by completing one of the assignments below.  If you get stuck, your coaches are experts and want to help - just ask!  Don't worry if the expert you are researching is not your favorite.  This is a small but important part of what we need to work on as a team as we prepare for competition.  We'll spend most of our time working on building and programming lego robots and working on our project.
