# Github Expert
## Thank you for being our Github expert!  As our expert you will learn how to safely backup our teams code. 
- It is no fun being stuck and not knowing what to do next.  Your coaches want to help you and provide expert help anytime you need it. Ask questions if you get stuck when following the directions below.
## Start by doing a little research. Use google or chatgpt to help answer the following questions.  Write down the answers in a shared doc or some way that can be easily shared with the rest of your team.
- What is Github, what is it used for?
- Can we save python programs to Github?
- Can we access the python programs we saved to Github from any computer that has access to the internet?
- Sharing and outreach with other FLL teams is a big part of FLL.  Can other teams see our python programs and learn from them?
- What is version control?
- What is a code repository?

## Now that you have some ideas of what Github can do, let's use it to save our code
- An electrical engineering expert has setup your Github [https://github.com/fll-18300/fall_2025](https://github.com/fll-18300/fall_2025)
- Make sure you are logged in to github.  The team username is team18300, ask you coach for the password.

- Work with the basebot experts helping them finish downloading and updating their code if they have not finished already.  Once the basebot experts complete their tasks, upload all python files (they end in .py) to github for safe storage.  You can do this by dragging the files onto the box shown below and then clicking commit changes.
