# LEGO CAD Expert
### Thank you for being our LEGO CAD expert.  In recent years, team 18300 has a tradition of learning Lego CAD together and using it to create a fun lego model of our team number like the two below.  If you've played minecraft or a similar game, with a little practice you'll be a master of LEGO CAD!

If you get stuck, ask for help from your team and coaches.  It is no fun being stuck and your coaches are here to provide expert help when you need it!

### Let's start by doing a little research, use google and the internet to answer the following questions:
- What is Computer Aided Design (CAD)?
- What is the software app, Lego Bricklink "Studio 2.0"?
- Can Lego Bricklink "Studio 2.0" be used to create Lego instructions?
- One of our team members is a bit of an expert with Studio 2.0, here are instructions from a recent boxbot build

- Lego CAD Studio 2.0 can be downloaded for free but it does need to be installed on a windows laptop.  In a meeting, use a laptop provided by your coach and Bricklink Studio 2.0 to create the number "1" in 18300 by stacking 10-15 lego bricks.  Decorate it with Archeology items (shovels, brooms, or go full Indian Jones and add snakes! it is up to you, have fun with it!)
