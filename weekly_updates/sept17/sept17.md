## Existing solutions

Large Scale:
- The UF-1000 is the largest stand-alone underwater filter made by Tri Nuclear Corp. This system is specifically designed for processing significant amounts of water rapidly for water clarity.

- The SedVac Sediment Dredge System is a sediment removal system designed to clean your clarifier by effectively removing the compression zone layer of sludge. Unlike clog-prone vacuum pipes, the SedVac system can handle high concentrations of sludge and grit and is capable of consistently removing solids of 3% concentration across a wide range of influent quality.

Large Scale:

- Because we pump a low volume of water, and a high concentration of solids, we are able to contain, separate and manage the spoils and return water with ease. Return water filters out with good clarity but then passes through a permeation berm where it’s filtered to an even cleaner level and allowed to return to the source. 

Small Scale:

- Wet/Dry filters are a must for any aquatic ecosystem, they enhance biological filtration as well as mechanical filtration with the proper pump they will cut down maintenance time and do a much better job than traditional filters including canister filters.

## Novel Aspects 
So purely copying the idea of filtering water wouldn’t be very novel in the context of FLL research/innovation. Judges usually want either:
- A new application
- A clever twist
- A low-cost / accessible version that solves a problem differently

## Possible Elevator Pitch
Archaeologists often struggle with murky water when exploring underwater dig sites, which slows research and can damage fragile artifacts. Our project creates a filtration system which is unique because _____________________, it clears water and _____________________.  This approach is good because ___________________________________.

## Novel Aspects:
3D Time-Lapse Dig
- Instead of just photos or video, our camera makes a new 3D model every few minutes. You can replay the dig like a movie, but in 3D.

Easy Grid System
- We can put special markers (like giant QR codes) around the dig square. The computer sees them and always knows where things are, no fancy survey gear needed.

Smart Find Logging
- Each artifact has a barcode or RFID tag. When we scan it, the system instantly saves its ID and exact 3D location in the dig.

AR Replay
- After the dig, you can hold up a tablet and see where the objects were buried, as if they re-appeared in the ground.

Low-Cost Kit
- Instead of super-expensive pro tools, our setup uses webcams and simple tags

## Possible Elevator Pitch
- Project roject is a low-cost system to record an excavation in 3D. A stereo camera above the dig makes a 3D time-lapse, so you can replay the dig as it happened. When an artifact is scanned with a barcode tag, the system automatically logs its exact spot. You can even use 3D videos afterward to see the artifacts appear back in the ground.
