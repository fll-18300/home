## ROBOT

- Pick a basebot
- Build Copies of the basebot using [3D build instructions](https://fll-18300.github.io/home/)
- Mission Ranking Table & Neighborhoods

### Team Experts
Become an expert by completing one of the assignments below.  If you get stuck, your coaches are experts and want to help - just ask!  Don't worry if the expert you are researching is not your favorite.  This is a small but important part of what we need to work on as a team as we prepare for competition.  We'll spend most of our time working on building and programming lego robots and working on our project.
- [Basebot Expert](basebot.html) - Research and help the team setup the base code and updated the build instructions for the robot.
- [Engineering Design Process Expert](engineering.html) - Research the engineering design process and answer a few questions to help us understand how to brainstorm, prototype, and fix our robot
- [Github Expert](github.html) - Research Github and answer a few questions.  Then upload files to our team Github account
- [Jira Expert](jira.html) - Research JIRA and answer a few questions.  Then create a task in our team JIRA account
- [Lego CAD Expert](lego_cad.html) - Research CAD and answer a few questions.  Then create a small lego CAD creation.

## Project 

### Leading Problems:

### CHALLENGE #1: Tediuos and slow to keep track of where dig site items are found.  Need to measure where each item is found in the excavation pit.  Each item needs to be tagged and recorded in a notebook.  Once the site has been excavated it is destroyed.  You only get one shot at preserving context and recording the data.

Examples of Dig Site Grids:

### CHALLENGE #2: Difficult to see underwater, difficult to keep diver orientation when they can't see.

### Examples of underwater diving with low visibility:

### Other Problems:
- Difficult to find sites
- Weather, rain and mud
- Time challenges, sites are only available for a short while.

  Brainstorm one of these challenges and come up with solutions.  Use your chromebooks to research if needed.
